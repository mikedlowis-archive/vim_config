Vim Configuration
=================

This is my vim configuration. I have a variety of tweaks  and settings that
make vim much more comfortable for writing code day in and day out. The bulk of
the settings are in vimrc but I also have a few syntax files, a color scheme,
and a modified version of the DoxygenToolkit plugin.
