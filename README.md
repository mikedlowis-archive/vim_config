Vim Configuration
=================

This is my vim configuration. I have a variety of tweaks  and settings that make
vim much more comfortable for writing code day in and day out. The bulk of the
settings are in vimrc but there are 3 plugins that provide features not already
builtin to vim.

### Plugins Used

* NERD Tree (Tree view directory browser)
* Kwbd (Delete a buffer without destroying your window layout)
* minibufexpl (provides a tab-like view of open buffers)
